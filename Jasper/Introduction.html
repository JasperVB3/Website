            My most important hobby is playing music. I play many difrent instruments like guitar, piano, harmonica and singing. I also play in two bands. My first band is called The 7 s√ºnden. My second band is called Soundshot. 
            My main intrest is Guitars. I love all sorts of guitars but the most beuthifull guitars are from the brand gibson and fender. <a href="Guitars.html">More about these brands</a>

            I also like to record cover songs. When they are finished I set them online on Youtube. Here is a example of a cover.
